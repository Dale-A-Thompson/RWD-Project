\f0\fs24 \cf0 Cyberpunk 2077 is being delayed yet again, this time until December 10th. Developer CD Projekt Red says it\'92s still working on a launch day patch for the game, which was previously slated for November 19th. It attributes the delay partly to its multiplatform release \'97 which will see the game launch across two generations of console hardware, PC, and Google Stadia.\
\
\'93The biggest challenge for us right now is shipping the game on current-gen, next-gen, and PC at the same time, which requires us to prepare and test nine versions of it,\'94 the company said in a tweet. \'93We need to make sure everything works well and every version runs smoothly. We\'92re aware it might seem unrealistic when someone says 21 days can make any difference in such a massive and complex game, but they really do.\'94\
\
Cyberpunk 2077 officially went gold (i.e. locked a release version of the game) in early October, and the developers promised via Twitter that \'93no more delays are happening.\'94 The release version is still finished, but CD Projekt Red has been developing further updates for the day of the game\'92s release. \'93This is the time period we under-calculated,\'94 the tweet says \'97 even after an unanticipated crunch period that\'92s seen developers working overtime.\
\
Cyberpunk 2077 has been one of the most highly anticipated games of 2020. But with the latest delay, it\'92s going to be just squeaking in at the end of this year.}
